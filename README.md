### The Game
[Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) implemented in JavaScript with jQuery.

The game is hosted [here](http://pawelswiecki.github.io/game-of-life/).

With left mouse button you can animate dead cells, as well as kill living cells on board to the left. Use `Live` button to apply the following rules to them:

* Alive cell dies if has fewer than two live neighbours (under-population).
* Alive cell dies if has more than three live neighbours (overcrowding).
* Alive cell lives on to the next generation if has two or three live neighbours.
* Dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell (reproduction).
